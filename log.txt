2010-01-02	Added new PCtowork with repository

2009-11-26	Added window with min-max ranges

2009-11-24	Added Charts

2009-11-23	Added collection of all using parameters. Added possibility to iterate and check existance of parameters in collections
2009-11-16	CalculationOptionTreeView added

2009-10-21	Added some calculation options
2009-10-21	Fixed problem with sorting. Now umbers compared correctly
2009-10-21	Fixed problem with rounding. Added possibility to change amount of displayed digits

2009-10-13	Rounding of numbers: 3 digits after coma
2009-10-13	Now Full info is disables as default
2009-10-13	Added calculation option Standart 4

2009-10-09	When you create new serie, it contains simulation with almost all data copy from previous selected simulation. Only Name of simulation will have new value: serieName + "-1"
2009-10-09	Now we have options {sim, serie, suspension} to enter material parameters for a whole group
2009-10-06	Now calculation option is separate for each simulatiom

2009-09-25	Tabbing problem fixed
2009-09-25	Developed calculations of standart option

2009-09-22	Highlighting of a rows. Rows in a table highlighs now by coloring in more dark color

2009-09-22	Area removed from simSeries
2009-09-22	When [duplicate] program add "_d" to the name os serie/simulation
2009-09-22	Tabulating in eta, rho, C table seems to be fixed (need good testing, or to discuss it via phone)

2009-09-19	Added duplicating of serie(with simulations) and simulation
2009-09-19	Added possibility to resize the whole window. Now you can use program with any resolution.
2009-09-19	Simulation parameters panel and suspension parameters panel merged to one panel.


TABulating between tables
Selecting of a first elements at startup
Highlighting of a row
byChecking conception for Machine Type table
Add units
Assign some default values for the Series and Simulation names (need to discuss what exactly)
some problems with selections (selectin of the first element in the table doesn't work correctly)
